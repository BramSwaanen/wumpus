<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>
    The game you are about to play is set in a mine and you are the miner looking for gold. But beware: there is an ugly, dangerous Wumpus hiding in the cave. <br>
    Also, there are deadly pits. Your goal is to obtain a piece of gold without stepping onto a square where a Wumpus hides or where a pit is. <br>
    Luckily, you have the tools of one arrow and your impeccable reasoning skills. You get hints as to where the pits <br>
    and Wumpus may be: whenever the Wumpus is in a square directly adjacent to yours (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally), <br>
    you sense a 'stench'; whenever a pit is in a square directly adjacent to yours (also not diagonally) you observe a 'breeze'. <br>
    Whenever you kill the Wumpus, it disappears and you immediately observe the square where it was without having to walk onto it. <br>
    The controls are as follows: <br>
    - Up/down/left/right keys for movement; <br>
    - Space bar to fire an arrow; <br>
    - Enter to obtain gold. <br>
    <br>
    The objective of the game is to obtain as many points as possible. Points are counted as follows: <br>
    - A move is -10 points; <br>
    - Shooting the arrow is -30 points; <br>
    - Obtaining the gold is +1000 points; <br>
    - Being killed by the wumpus or a pit is -1000 points; <br>
    <br>
    Really try to get as many points as possible. <br>
    <br>
    Whenever you step onto a square with a pit or Wumpus you're game over. Whenever you obtain the gold you win. In both cases you will be directed <br>
    to the next level. <br>
    <br>
    You will play the game for different configurations of the world and we aks to explain your thought process as explicitly as possible. <br>
    Try to explain every thought step you make to the camera while playing the game. Whenever you are game over or obtain the gold you will <br>
    automatically be directed to the next level if you press "Next Level" in the pop-up message. Please turn of your computer's sound as well.<br>
    <br>
    You will first get to play a practice level. After that you will be directed to the 'real' experiment, which consists of 3 levels. <br>
    <br>
    Have fun! <br>
